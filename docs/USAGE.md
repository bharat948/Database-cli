## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your query, the better the LLM can understand your intent.

2. **Confirm Destructive Operations**: Always double-check before confirming destructive operations like delete or drop.

3. **Check Collection Names**: Make sure to use the correct collection names in your queries.

4. **Use Limits**: When retrieving documents, consider adding a limit to avoid retrieving too many documents.

5. **Query Parameters**: For complex queries, be explicit about fields and conditions.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you see a connection error:

1. Verify your MongoDB URI in the `.env` file
2. Ensure your MongoDB server is running
3. Check network connectivity and firewall settings

### LLM Parsing Issues

If the LLM misunderstands your query:

1. Try rephrasing the query to be more specific
2. Include field names and explicit conditions
3. Break complex queries into simpler ones

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors:

1. Ensure your MongoDB user has the necessary permissions
2. Check database and collection access rights
